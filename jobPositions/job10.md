## About the Role

We are seeking a skilled Senior Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET), from Senior level and above, to join our team at Inworld AI.

The ideal candidate is someone who has been extremely hands-on and productive with code throughout their SDET career: writing tests, developing stable test infrastructure, debugging flakes, and so on.

## Focus Areas

- The **Inworld Runtime** - A cross-platform library for orchestrating AI computations via graphs. Currently distributed as a NodeJS package, and we have versions for Unreal, Unity, and other platforms in the works. The focus here is on automated testing of the graph and node facilities, which expose common AI building blocks (LLM, TTS, STT, Knowledge/Rag, Memory, etc).
- APIs, especially our recently announced **TTS API**. The focus here is automated testing the API functionality. For example, with TTS, advancing our ability to test voice quality and timestamp accuracy in an automated fashion, even though both are fuzzy problems.
- UI tests of our web experience via Playwright.
- Automation tools and pipelines related to testing.

## Key Responsibilities

- Design, create and maintain test cases and suites for our most important priorities, such as the Inworld Runtime, TTS and other APIs. Especially, demonstrate an ability to zero in on the most important things to test when new features or releases happen, and develop the tests quickly.
- Expand and improve our test infrastructure, whether it's in Playwright, Python, C++, NodeJS, Unreal, or Unity. We'll need this person to increase stability and improve our testing leverage.
- Develop and evolve other tools and CI/CD workflows related to our automated tests, including GitHub actions/workflows.
- Collaborate across roles (engineering, product, project management, etc) to ensure our results are high quality and we stay focused on the benefit to our customers and their end users.

## Qualifications

- 5+ years of experience in software/game development with a focus on C++, C#, Python, NodeJS or similar programming languages and test automation.
- Hands-on experience with automation tools and CI/CD processes (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.).

## Nice-to-have

- Background in Quality Assurance and familiarity with performance and stress testing.
- Experience with test automation frameworks and tools, e.g. Playwright, Cypress.
- Experience with building and testing for multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, and Mac.
- Familiarity with LLM models.

**In-office location:** Mountain View, California, United States. Candidates must be based in the SF Bay Area or willing to relocate (you will be working on-site in our South Bay office a few days a week).
